# Humanoids

The field of humanoid robotics focuses on the creation of robots that are directly inspired by human capabilities with similar kinematics, sensing and behavior to humans. They are developed as general purpose mechanical workers, entertainers, and test beds for theories from neuroscience and experimental psychology.

Over the last decade, the humanoids research community has grown dramatically. Whether or not humanoids become a dominant form for robots may depend on the extent to which they can compete against specialized robots that are better suited to particular tasks and human labor, which in some ways already meets the ultimate goals of humanoid robotics.
